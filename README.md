# The-Last-of-Us-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis

The Last of Us recently got ported to PC through a Remastered version. I read through it's older reviews as I was planning to get it but I thought, why not get a better understanding of reviews through a little analysis of my own :D

The dataset was taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lazaro97/the-last-of-us-reviews.

For this analysis, I only used the user reviews for the base game i.e. 'user_reviews_g1' dataset.

71.1% of users gave it a perfect 10, which is a considerably high score for a videogame.

The Wordcloud also generated mostly positive words:

Most of the Sentimental scores are Neutral, although the Positive score easily overwhelms the Negative one:

Neutral:  1333.69

Positive:  668.06

Negative:  145.26
