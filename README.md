# The-Last-of-Us-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis

The Last of Us recently got ported to PC through a Remastered version. I read through it's older reviews as I was planning to get it but I thought, why not get a better understanding of reviews through a little analysis of my own :D

The dataset was taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lazaro97/the-last-of-us-reviews.

For this analysis, I only used the user reviews for the base game i.e. 'user_reviews_g1' dataset.

71.8% of users gave it a perfect 10, which is a considerably high score for a videogame.

The Wordcloud also generated mostly positive words:

The Sentimental scores are dominated by Neutrals, although the Positive scores easily overwhelm the Negative ones:

Neutral:  1879.25

Positive:  682.85

Negative:  150.91
